9/1:
Started the wood pen project by selecting the wood and cutting it using the wood-cutting machine.

9/3:
Finished cutting the wood and glued the pieces together.

9/4:
Drilled a hole through the wooden pieces and glued the metal shaft inside.

9/5:
Began turning the pen, but one of the wooden pieces broke during the process. I planned to remake that piece the next day.

9/8:
Cut a new piece of wood and glued the pieces together again.

9/9:
Inserted the metal shaft into the hole and attempted to log in to GitHub.

9/10:
Turned the new wooden piece and sanded both sections of the pen.

9/12:
Completed the pen by assembling all the pieces together.

## Capstone Project - Yearbook Digitization

So far in my capstone project, I have made steady progress toward digitizing past Charlotte Latin yearbooks. I began by setting up my yearbook folder on GitHub and configuring the environment for my Landing.ai key to prepare for AI-assisted data extraction. I then understood the workflows for the different new codes, I worked with Mr. Dubick to review the 1975 and 1976 yearbooks, recording page numbers for sports and activities to organize the content structure. I edited YAML files to store this information. Finally, I tested the Landing.ai code for automatically extracting data from grades 6–11 using the YAML file, code file, and the new team Landing.AI key I got. 

**Timeline:**

10/1:
Revised and updated daily journals. Researched agents and orchestration techniques in Python.

10/6:
Worked with Mr. Dubick to understand the yearbook workflow. Reviewed the 1975 yearbook to record page numbers for sports and activities, organizing them into a list.

10/7:
Collected and recorded page numbers for the 1976 yearbook YAML file.

10/9:
Tested the team Landing.ai code for grade extraction across grades 6–11.

10/10:
Practiced 3D printing by printing a joy fidget toy. Also practiced laser cutting using both auto-focus and manual focus settings.

10/17:
Mr.Dubick taught us about setting up Github pages.
