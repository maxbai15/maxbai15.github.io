## PCB Board Creation Project

**Timeline**

10/27:
Received 3 PCB design files and generated the G-code using MakeraCam. Each file represented a different layer of the board, the copper traces, drill holes, and outline cut.

10/29:
Attempted to use the CNC machine to cut the board for the first time. We ran into a major issue, the measurements for the copper board size were incorrect in the G-code, causing the CNC cuts to be misplaced on the copper board. The scaling and origin were off, so the traces didn’t line up properly.

10/30:
Fixed the scaling issue by ensuring all units matched between MakeraCam and the CNC software (using millimeters). We re-exported the G-code and after all the troubleshooting, the board cut correctly and aligned perfectly.

**Reflection:**
This project taught me how important it is to check scaling, units, and alignment before running the CNC. After fixing those issues, we were able to successfully cut the PCB board, and it matched our schematic perfectly.
